# Beta testing

## Not CS Person
- Too fast
- It's hard to jump over the a lot of cactus
- change speed as game goes on
- change the how to botton and the Modes botton
- make the dark mode switch in game over not just when you reset
- add coins 

## What I did to fix it
- I made the game start slow and then as time goes on it gets faster
- I made gravity lower and did the velocity higher so that you can jump higher and for longer.
- For every 40 points the speed gets higher by 1.
- made it an I and for the modes botton i made it switch weather were in dark or light mode

## CS person
- Weird line on leg in light mode
- Start Screen is Plain add 'press space to start'
- Fix empty space in between scrolling pictures
- change the sun colour
- Make the dinosaur bigger
- Make the distances between the cactai random because it's predictable after a while.

## What I did to fix it
- added 'press space to start' on startscreen
- made the dinoaur twice its size
