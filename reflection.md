## reflection

# what advice would you give to yourself if you were to start a project like this again?
- I would add comments as I went on more and used better variable names
- Also I would focus less on the "aesthetics" and more in implementing features to make it more creative

# did you complete everything in your “needs to have” list?
- Yes, I completed everything in my needs to have and most of my nice to haves.

# What was the hardest part of the project?
- The hard part was mainly getting all the pictures right and all the dinos to be the same size, I was almost more on paint than vs code.

# Were there any problems you could not solve?
- Not all my dinos are the same size :/
- There was a weird gap that showed up in the background, I didn't fix it but I found a fix around it by added another stationary image to the background.
